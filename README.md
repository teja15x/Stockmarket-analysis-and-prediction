Stock Market Analysis and Prediction using Python | Risk analysis, visualization, and Monte Carlo simulation for forecasting stock prices.

# Introduction

The Stock Market Analysis and Prediction project focuses on performing technical analysis, visualization, and forecasting using stock market data sourced from Google Finance. The study primarily explores major technology companies and other selected stocks. Using Pandas, stock data is extracted and analyzed to visualize key market trends and evaluate the performance of various stocks. Additionally, the project examines the risk factor associated with each stock based on its historical performance and predicts future stock prices using the Monte Carlo simulation method.

# Purpose

The main objective of this project is to analyze and compare the effectiveness of different predictive algorithms applied to stock market data, while gaining valuable insights through statistical and visual exploration. The project integrates concepts from Data Mining, Statistics, and Financial Analysis to forecast stock behavior and assess Value at Risk (VaR) for each asset.
It leverages powerful Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data manipulation, computation, and visualization.
